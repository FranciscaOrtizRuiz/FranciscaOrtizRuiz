🔭 I'm currently working on **social network analysis, personal networks, social support, and mixed methods**. I'm always open to new colaborations and ideas! 

Bio: Francisca Ortiz Ruiz is **currently doing her PhD in the Department of Sociology at the Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis, The University of Manchester, UK**. Country in which she has been living the last four years. Currently is the co-chair of the PhD and early career network of MICRA, and a collaboratior with GeroActivismo Fundation. Her research is about how older people construct their support network to live with a neoliberal system of pensions, from a mixed-method and longitudinal perspective. Since 2010 she has been working in the editorial board of the “Revista Contenido. Cultura y Ciencias Sociales” Journal, which she founded and directed between 2010 and 2017. In 2016 founded the “Mecanismos Sociales” consultancy, in which she is still the co-director. For four years she was an assistant researcher in the Centre of Sociocultural Research in Alberto Hurtado University. She had experience working in consultancy and research projects for almost ten years, forming up to today an active role in several collaborative scientific networks, specially in some with a strong methodological approach. She had her work published in more than 20 publications on indexed journals (including a book edited by her) and has presented in many national and international conferences about methodology, results of research and public impact. Her areas of specialization are mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative tools), social network analysis, relational sociology and social gerontology.

I also have a [Podcast about social network analysis](https://knittingnetworks.com)! Its called Knitting Networks with chapters in Spanish and English, and it is hosted by [Alejandro Espinosa-Rada](https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/alejandro.espinosa.html) and myself.
