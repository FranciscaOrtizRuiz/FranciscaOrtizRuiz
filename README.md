Bio: I am **currently doing my PhD in the Department of Sociology at the Mitchell Centre for Social Network Analysis, The University of Manchester, UK**. Country in which I have been living the last four years. Currently I am the co-chair of the PhD and early career network of **MICRA**, and a collaboratior with **GeroActivismo Fundation**. Her research is about how older people construct their support network to live with a neoliberal system of pensions, from a mixed-method and longitudinal perspective. Since 2010 I have been working in the editorial board of the **Revista Contenido. Cultura y Ciencias Sociales**, which she founded and directed between 2010 and 2017. In 2016 founded the **Mecanismos Sociales** consultancy, in which I'm still the co-director. For four years I was an assistant researcher in the **Centre of Sociocultural Research in Alberto Hurtado University**.
